== Installation ==

The automatic plugin installer should work for most people. Manual installation is  
easy and takes fewer than five minutes.

1. Download the plugin, unpack it and upload the '<em>wpic</em>' folder to your  
wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -> WPIC Options to configure the default options.

Now for the real question, <strong>how do I use this plugin?</strong>

First of all go to the plugin's options panel, and set up your default settings. Then  
copy the shortcode displayed at the top of the options page to your page/post. Click  
between the begging of the shortcode, and the end of it which will place your cursor  
at the following position:
`[wpic]SOMEWHERE HERE![/wpic]`
Then click on the "Add Media" button and select the images that you want the  
carousel to display by  holding the control key, and click on the images. Now take a  
look at the size of your images in the bottom-right corner. Make sure you select the  
same size for each image you would like to display. Take note of the this size. Hit the  
insert into post button, and wait for the images to display. As a reminder, the images  
should display "inside" the shortocde, between the end and the beginning. Take a  
look at the image you added, and between each image add the following two  
characters:
`/!` (leading slash and exclamation mark). Do not add the two characters before the  
first image, or after the last image. Take a look at the screenshots tab, to get a picture  
of what you have to do. You can edit the shortcode settings like changing the color  
of the buttons, or the speeds. Next, update the width and height settings of the  
shortcode so that they would match the dimensions of your images (the one we  
took note of earlier). If the dimensions of the images are the same dimensions you  
entered in the default plugin settings, then delete the width and height shortcode  
settings. (If you are having troubles with this part, do not hesitate to ask on the  
forums). Everything should be set, try publishing the post/page and viewing it. If  
everything worked, then great! If not, re-read these steps, take a look at the  
screenshots, or ask on the forums. We are going to try to replay as fast as possible.
